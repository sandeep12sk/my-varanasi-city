        <p>Varanasi is one of the world's oldest continually inhabited cities. Kashi, its ancient name, was associated
            with a kingdom of the same name of 2,500 years ago. The Lion capital of Ashoka at nearby Sarnath has been
            interpreted to be a commemoration of the Buddha's first sermon there in the fifth century BCE. In
            the 8th century, Adi Shankara established the worship of Shiva as an official sect of Varanasi. Tulsidas
            wrote his Awadhi language epic, the Ramcharitmanas, a Bhakti movement reworking of the Sanskrit Ramayana, in
            Varanasi. Several other major figures of the Bhakti movement were born in Varanasi, including Kabir and
            Ravidas. In the 16th century, Rajput nobles in the service of the courts and armies of the Mughal
            emperor Akbar, sponsored the building or further enhancement of the major Shiva temple in the city; they
            also built other temples, all displaying an empire-wide architectural style. Under the Treaty of
            Faizabad, the East India Company acquired Benares in 1775, the city later successively becoming a
            part of the Benares Division in the Ceded and Conquered Provinces, the North-Western Provinces, and the
            United Provinces, and after India's independence of Uttar Pradesh</p>
